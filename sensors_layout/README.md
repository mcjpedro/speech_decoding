# SENSORS LAYOUT

These files were used in the analysis to generically describe the placement of electrodes along the participants scalps. The coordinates used are compatible 
with the [64-channel ANT cap](https://www.ant-neuro.com/sites/default/files/images/waveguard_layout_064ch.png). Note that to facilitate the analysis focused only on the EEG records of interest, the file sersors_layout_without_bad_ch.ced was used by the processing pipeline. .ced files are natively read by the EEGLab library.
